# React Styled Text

We want to help you to setup **Typography** in your project.

## What is this and what is not?

This is a **TOOL**, not the whole solution. Actually, if you think about it no generic package/library will perfectly adjust to what you really want, it is inevitable that some customization will be needed, but the problem is that `they try and they have some believer`.

## So, why to use this?

Hopefully `react-styled-text` will save you approximately two **hundred lines of code**, YEAH just that. We have cretaed a nicely simple component with 80 lines, 80 lines of testing, 20 lines of types definition and of course a lot of passion when building it.

Without forwer explanations lets go technical:

## Instalation

`yarn add react-styled-text`
or
`npm install react-styled-text`
